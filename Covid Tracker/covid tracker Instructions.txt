I learned this code from Code_EduYear.

before running this COVID TRACKER program make sure you have installed these following libraries

1. COVID (open source library)
2. matplotlib (for displaying data (write it as "matplotlib.pyplot" while using this in program))

after installation of these two libraries, you are good to go.
